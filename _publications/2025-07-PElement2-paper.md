excerpt: "Transposable elements (TEs) are mobile DNA sequences that can disrupt genome function. In this study, we investigated how natural selection acts to remove harmful TE insertions by tracking the invasion of the P-element—a highly active TE—in laboratory populations of *Drosophila simulans*. Using experimental evolution and whole-genome sequencing over time, we monitored how P-element copy numbers changed across generations. We combined this data with machine learning models to estimate the strength of purifying selection acting against new insertions. Our results show that around 73% of new P-element insertions are harmful and are being removed by selection, revealing that purifying selection plays a major role in controlling TE spread. This work demonstrates how experimental evolution, paired with computational modeling, can uncover the evolutionary forces shaping genome architecture."
