collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2025-08-Evolution-Digest
excerpt: "This Evolution Digest summarizes recent research by Prileson et al. on how winter survival can cause rapid evolutionary change in fruit fly populations. The original study shows that conditions experienced during overwintering can drive rapid adaptation, but that these changes may come with trade-offs — notably, reduced resistance to insecticides."
