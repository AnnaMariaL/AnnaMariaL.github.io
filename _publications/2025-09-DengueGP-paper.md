excerpt: "Detailed individual-based models can capture a high degree of realism, but their complexity often makes them too slow or cumbersome to explore fully. In this work, we explore how Gaussian Process emulation — a statistical method for building fast, accurate surrogate models — can help overcome this challenge. First, we developed an individual-based model that simulates disease spread in a population, accounting for features such as social structure, human mobility, and seasonal variation in infection risk. We then trained a Gaussian Process surrogate model on epidemiological metrics derived from the outputs of this individual-based model, which allowed us to predict these metrics almost instantly across a wide range of parameter values. This approach made it possible to systematically explore which factors drive simulated epidemics. We found that two variables — average infectivity and average mobility — had the greatest influence on whether and how outbreaks occurred. Our results demonstrate that Gaussian Process emulation offers a practical and powerful way to study complex disease systems. While we applied this approach to infectious disease transmission, the underlying method can be useful for analyzing many other types of detailed, simulation-based models."
