# Current Research Topics

## 1. How does environmental heterogeneity influence the genomic footprint of adaptation?

  <p> Understanding how organisms adapt to rapidly changing environments is crucial, especially in the context of global climate change. Adaptation often involves evolutionary trade-offs, where adjusting to one challenge, such as insecticides, may affect other traits like heat tolerance. My research investigates how environmental heterogeneity influences the spread of adaptive mutations, considering these pleiotropic effects. In this context, classic population genetic models only provide limited insights as they assume random mating and spatial homogeneity. To address this, I employ individual-based simulations and statistical frameworks to explore how environmental heterogeneity shapes the genomic footprint of insecticide resistance and affects adaptation dynamics across time and space.

    This research explores how spatial and genetic structures influence evolutionary outcomes.
    We use simulation tools like SLiM to model gene flow, selection, and drift across heterogeneous landscapes.

  <p>
Computational advancements and the development of powerful agent-based simulation frameworks have allowed us to model unprecedented realism in mosquito-transmitted diseases â€“ a threat that millions of people face every year. While this enhanced realism has already provided important insights, agent-based models are still often outperformed in disease forecasting by their idealized mathematical counterparts. This might be caused by a lack in our fundamental understanding of how spatial dynamics need to be appropriately modeled. To date, in depth sensitivity analyses of complex agent-based models that would help to address this issue are hardly conducted, because these complex models are very parameter rich. Thus, the required model recalibration and comparisons are very runtime intensive. I introduce Gaussian processes as a powerful statistical framework that will significantly advance sensitivity analysis for agent-based models and allow us to assess the relative input importance of different model parameters in unprecedented detail. The proposed research could further deepen our understanding of how spatial structure affects host-pathogen dynamics and be a valuable contribution to the field of sensitivity analysis for agent-based models. I expect to find that spatial structure changes disease transmission potential profoundly and can cause spatial-specific model dynamics. I hope that my findings contribute to the improvement of disease forecasting and evaluation of proposed intervention strategies.
