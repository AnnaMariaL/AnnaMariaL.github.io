## 1. How does environmental heterogeneity influence the genomic footprint of adaptation?

  <p style="display: block; margin-top: 0;">  Understanding how organisms adapt to rapidly changing environments is crucial, especially in the context of global climate change. Adaptation often involves evolutionary trade-offs, where adjusting to one challenge, such as insecticides, may affect other traits like heat tolerance. My research investigates how environmental heterogeneity influences the spread of adaptive mutations, considering these pleiotropic effects. In this context, classic population genetic models only provide limited insights as they assume random mating and spatial homogeneity. To address this, I employ individual-based simulations and statistical frameworks to explore how environmental heterogeneity shapes the genomic footprint of insecticide resistance and affects adaptation dynamics across time and space.

## 2. How does purifying selection shape transposable element invasions?

  <p style="display: block; margin-top: 0;"> 
    I study transposable elements (TEs), DNA sequences that can replicate within their host genomes. While the underrepresentation of TEs in coding regions suggests that purifying selection acts against new insertions, little is known about the balance between mutational pressure from TEs and the selection opposing them. My research investigates the distribution of fitness effects of new TE insertions in <i>Drosophila simulans</i>, using experimental evolution combined with statistical emulation. Focusing on the P-element, a well-known TE in <i>Drosophila species</i>, I show that most P-element insertions are deleterious and subject to strong purifying selection. This work highlights the power of combining experimental evolution, individual-based modeling, and machine learning to uncover the complex dynamics of TE invasions.

## 3. How does population structure influence host-pathogen dynamics in mosquito-transmitted diseases?

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; margin-bottom: 2em;">
  <img src="../images/GP-concept.jpg" alt="GPs in Epidemiology" style="width: 40%; margin-right: 2em;">
  <p style="display: block; margin-top: 0;"> Epidemiological models that aim for a high degree of biological realism by simulating every individual in a population are unavoidably complex, with many free parameters, which makes systematic explorations of their dynamics computationally challenging. In this project, I investigate the potential of Gaussian Process emulation to overcome this obstacle. To simulate disease dynamics, I developed a complex individual-based model in that is loosely inspired by dengue, incorporating some key features shaping dengue epidemics such as social structure, human movement, and seasonality. I trained three Gaussian Process surrogate models on three outcomes: outbreak probability, maximum incidence, and epidemic duration. These models enable the rapid prediction of outcomes at any point in the eight-dimensional parameter space of the original individual-based model. My analysis revealed average human mobility as one of the key drivers of these epidemiological metrics. We use a dataset comprising more than 1,000 dengue epidemics observed over 12 years in Colombia to calibrate our Gaussian Process model and evaluate its predictive power. The calibrated Gaussian Process model identifies a subset of municipalities with consistently higher average infectivity estimates, illustrating the potential of statistical emulation for facilitating (empirical) data analysis. Overall, this work underscores the potential of Gaussian Process emulation to enable the use of more complex individual-based models in epidemiology, allowing a higher degree of realism and accuracy that should increase our ability to control diseases of public health concern.
