I’m happy to share that I have **two new publications** out, spanning statistical emulation and rapid adaptation.

**1. Gaussian process emulation for exploring complex infectious disease models**

In our new *PLOS Computational Biology* paper, we introduce Gaussian Processes as an attractive tool to explore detailed, computationally intensive infectious disease models. By combining epidemiological modeling with modern machine-learning tools, this work helps researchers better understand how model parameters shape simulated epidemic outcomes.

[Check out the paper here](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013849)



**2. Evolution Digest on winter-driven adaptation**

I also wrote an *Evolution Digest* summarizing recent research on how winter conditions can drive rapid evolutionary change in natural populations.
