New paper out in Science (including cool cover art)! "Deep cis-regulatory homology of the butterfly wing pattern ground plan" studies the evolution and role of cis-regulatory elements of a patterning gene in five different butterfly species. 
Fun cross-disciplinary collaboration with Anyi Mazo-Vargos, Robert Reed, and others.
