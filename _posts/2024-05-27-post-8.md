The department of Biomathematics was actively participating in the [Long Night of Research](https://langenachtderforschung.at/) in Vienna - a biannual national science outreach event. 
We discussed with the visitors our research projects, explored the emergence of collective behavior, and simulated epidemics with playing cards. 
Couldn't make it? All our material is avaliable [online](https://sites.google.com/view/saramerinoaceituno/outreach/lange-nacht-der-forschung-2024?authuser=0)!
