The first postdoc preprint is available: _"Catching a wave: on the suitability of traveling-wave solutions in epidemiological modeling"_ ! We use diffusion-theory and individual-based models 
to figure out when exactly limited individual dispersal start to affect disease dynamics, such that spatial structure needs to be considered. 
The preprint is available on [bioRxiv](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.06.23.546298). Check out the _"Research" tab for more details.
