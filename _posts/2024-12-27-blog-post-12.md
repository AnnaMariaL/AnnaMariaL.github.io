New paper out in [Theoretical Population Biology](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040580924001072)! 
We investigate spatial structure in disease models, revealing when spatial heterogeneity must be considered for accurate predictions and how it impacts key epidemiological outcomesâ€”bridging theory and simulations for more realistic epidemic modeling.
