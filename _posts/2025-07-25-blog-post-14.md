Our latest study looks at how P-element insertions affect fitness in fruit flies. Using experimental evolution and machine learning, we tracked how these transposable elements spreadâ€”and found that most new insertions are harmful and selected against. Excited to see this work published in *Genome Biology*! Check it out [here.](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-025-03688-2)
