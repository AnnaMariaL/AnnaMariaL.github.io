I am delighted to start my new position as [AIAS-AUFF](https://aias.au.dk/aias-fellows/current-fellows/anna-maria-langmueller) fellow at the Aarhus Institute of Advanced Science.
In my project, I will use individual simulations and statistical frameworks to study how adaptation works across time and space.
